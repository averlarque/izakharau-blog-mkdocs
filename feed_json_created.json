And yes, I need to fill the vacuum while working on two new writing pieces: a book review and a new topic.</p>\n<h2>Writing Tools</h2>\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> as a knowledge base and content management. It is free, keeps your data in your hands, not in a vendor cloud, uses Markdown for formatting, and has a variety of great plugins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The latter is handy as my blog\u00a0is also built\u00a0with the <a href=\"https://www.mkdocs.org/\">MkDocs</a> engine based on the Markdown format. So, I keep writing and editing in Markdown, which is very convenient. I don't particularly appreciate it when each tool tries to reinvent the wheel with its custom formatting, which is incompatible with anyone else. With Markdown files stored on my local machine and my cloud storage, I can quickly grab them and migrate them to another tool.</p>\n<p>I use the <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/overview/\">Zettelkasten</a> technique in Obsidian when I research something and need to document some information and my thoughts to reference it later. You can find a lot of information about this approach. I keep my notes connected with tags and internal references where possible. Obsidian provides a nice graph where I can filter out some notes and track references.</p>\n<p>Once a year, I clean up by editing, merging, or even deleting some notes. So, I try to keep the number of my Markdown notes from spreading. You can see a part of the notes graph in the attached image below.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Graph view\" src=\"images/writing-routine/writing-routine-1.png\"></p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2024-05-14T09:00:00+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://ilyazakharau.com/barszawa-blog-edition-04-2024/", "url": "https://ilyazakharau.com/barszawa-blog-edition-04-2024/", "title": "BArszawa Blog - April\u201924 Edition is out!", "content_html": "<h1>BArszawa Blog - April\u201924 Edition is out!</h1>\n<p>A month has almost passed, so here is a new edition of the BArszawa blog, where I serve as a contributor and edit...</p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2024-04-30T09:00:00+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://ilyazakharau.com/requirements-api-analysis/", "url": "https://ilyazakharau.com/requirements-api-analysis/", "title": "A new part of Requirements & API - Analysis is available!", "content_html": "<p>Last month, I started summarizing all my API-related posts, workshops, and webinars into extended and structured reading.

Postponing the dependency means a delay in delivering your work and the expected outcome, which causes financial losses.==<img alt=\"Mixed pattern to resolve\" src=\"images/about_dependencies.jpg\">{ align=right width=50% }</p>\n<p>Your team/service can have one or several dependencies and be a dependency for someone else. Sometimes it can be both. And dependencies might be temporary when you need something to be done once or permanent when you continuously need something to operate.</p>\n<p>There can be external dependencies, meaning that you are waiting for something to be done outside your organization. Or that will be done inside your organization, which is an internal dependency.</p>\n<p>We can distinguish cross-team, cross-stream, and cross-department dependencies, each with its own peculiarities.</p>\n<p>In my world, dependency means an API or a software library. In your world, that may be anything else, like a vehicle part or a plumber to fix a pipeline leak.</p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2024-04-02T10:00:00+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://ilyazakharau.com/barszawa-blog-edition-03-2024/", "url": "https://ilyazakharau.com/barszawa-blog-edition-03-2024/", "title": "BArszawa Blog - March\u201924 Edition is out!", "content_html": "<h1>BArszawa Blog - March\u201924 Edition is out!</h1>\n<p>I am happy to introduce the third edition of the monthly BArszawa blog, to which I contribute as an author and ed...</p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2024-03-26T09:00:00+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://ilyazakharau.com/team-topologies/", "url": "https://ilyazakharau.com/team-topologies/", "title": "Thoughts about \"Team Topologies\" by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais", "content_html": "<h1>Thoughts about \"Team Topologies\" by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais</h1>\n<p>This time, let's talk about \"<a href=\"https://a.co/d/eu7mx3L\">Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow</a>,\" a book about organizational design written by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Book cover\" src=\"images/team_topologies_cover.jpg\">{ align=right }</p>\n<p><strong>Looking at the title, this book is not about product management or business analysis...</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, you are right.

It is not a standard but a guide that defines the scope of software engineering as a discipline (that is important to address). It outlines Knowledge Areas described in terms of its component processes, practices, inputs, outputs, tools, and techniques. Those areas are representations of the discipline at a particular moment.</p>\n<p>Of course, Software engineering can't ignore such a massive topic as requirements. So it contains a dedicated chapter, or, in SWEBOK terms, knowledge area (KA)  \"Software Requirements\".</p>\n<p>I started learning about industry standards and Bodies of Knowledge a few years ago. So I went through SWEBOK Guide v3, published in 2014, to review existing KAs focusing on the \"Software Requirements.\"</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://waseda.app.box.com/v/SWEBOK4-book\">4th version</a> is in the public review and will replace v3 soon. This article compares the Software Requirements chapter, my domain of interest, between newer and current versions. And there is what to compare. But let's go back to v3.</p>\n<p>And there is not much there. The KA heavily relies on an older edition (2nd) of the \"Software Requirements\" by Karl Wiegers and just a few other well-known sources. And the chapter itself is about 18 pages long. The Guide should not provide extensive information about a particular topic but should give an overview and further references to study.</p>\n<p>However, the provided information is insufficient to give an overview of such an essential piece of software engineering. Moreover, it struggles to offer a structured categorization of requirements types and a comprehensive overview of requirements practices.</p>\n<p>^^I am not criticizing; I am expressing my feeling that not enough attention was given to that part of SWEBOK.^^ And written in 2014, it quickly became outdated.</p>\n<p>I read it for the first time in 2020, and RUP (Rational Unified Process) has already been dead for a while. I barely heard about practicing RUP in 2014 because Agile methodologies were on the hype train then (and claimed to be dead soon, too). A newer generation of IT folks has no idea what it is.</p>\n<p>I could not recommend SWEBOK Guide v3 to start your journey to the requirements engineer or business analysis. Even at the moment of 2014, there were better sources and materials. This KA looks unarticulated compared to the further KAs.</p>\n<p>{==The good news is that v4 has done everything right!==}</p>\n<p>In 2024, I started revisiting the standards BOKs, researching some topics for future articles. For the sake of curiosity, I have looked into a draft version of SWEBOK Guide v4 (<em>2024 Jan 16th Public Review Version</em>). And I am surprised in a good way. The \"Software Requirements\" KA has been completely rewritten and extended. </p>\n<p>I am not going to dive deep into reviewing each point. You can easily read the document and make your conclusion. And we need to consider that it is still not a final version, and some changes are expected. However, I don't expect much will change: IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) folks and KA editors have done a great job.</p>\n<p>{++Let's see what v4 has done right compared to v3:++} </p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2024-02-11T21:00:00+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://ilyazakharau.com/replacing-legacy-blog-edition/", "url": "https://ilyazakharau.com/replacing-legacy-blog-edition/", "title": "Entire \"Replacing Legacy\" series is available on the Blog", "content_html": "<h1>Entire \"Replacing Legacy\" series is available on the Blog</h1>\n<p>For those who are not Medium fans, I've packed the <a href=\"https://ilyazakharau.com/essays/replacing-legacy/\">Replacing Legacy series</a> into the long read available on my blog.</p>\n<p>There are some slight differences from the original: some passages have been edited, and others have been removed.
