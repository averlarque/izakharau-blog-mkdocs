You don't need to be a developer or an architect to participate to design or even build an API, but there is something you should learn to succeed.</p> <p>So we start with API design-first, which takes the opportunity to democratize the API development process.</p>","tags":["API Design"]},{"location":"posts/api-design-first/#api-definition","title":"API Definition","text":"<p>Let's take a step back to explore the term \"API definition.\" I will take some points from my \"Definition of API requirements\" essay to keep all the needed information in one text.</p> <p>So, the API definition is a documented API contract - an agreement about expected input and outcome between you (API provider) and your clients who consume your API. API communication is formalized with the contract documented in a specific format. It covers what data should be sent to a particular web address and what is expected to return as a successful or failed response.</p> <p>Many types of such formats are usually technically-driven. OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) is the most common way to specify RESTful API, so that I will refer to it. You should study that format if you need to work with APIs. OpenAPI is not covered here, but later I will guide you on how to approach that study.</p> <p>So in our case, a JSON or YAML file with the contents aligned with OpenAPI specification acts as the API definition. The definition does not mean implementation. Our API can be defined on \"paper\" but does not yet exist as a deployed code running on a web server. It is important to separate those meanings like we separate requirements as a description of a system from the actual implementation.</p>","tags":["API Design"]},{"location":"posts/api-design-first/#what-api-design-first-means","title":"What API design-first means","text":"<p>API definition has two dimensions:</p> <p>Documentation: You can have API implementation with code and then autogenerate API definition to reflect the actual implementation. It is also called \"code-first\" and is a more traditional approach.</p> <p>Specification: You can design API definitions with your hands in a Notepad or use advanced tools to produce such machine-readable formats as OpenAPI. That allows autogenerating code for both the client and server sides. Or you can still develop it manually. Both ways lies in the concept we call \"API design-first.\"</p> <p>API definition can mediate between business logic, domain models, and UI. It can't cover them all, but there is no need for that. That can be considered a business analysis (BA) artifact, which may better transcribe business-to-system requirements than several written text lines.</p> <p></p> <p>Designing API definition helps to crystalize the data model and the operations to make your application functional. It is a ready-made contract between the backend and UI or API consumers. Such traditional BA artifacts as use cases, Entity-Relationship diagrams, and UI mockups are still required to specify the system requirements.</p> <p>I am usually advocating to keep a separate line between Requirements and Design. API definition lies between \"What?\" and \"How?\". It does not answer those questions for an entire system. But that might be beneficial if API is crucial in delivering value to your customers.</p>","tags":["API Design"]},{"location":"posts/api-design-first/#rise-of-api-design-first","title":"Rise of API design-first","text":"<p>I think it is related to the rising popularity of the \"API economy.\" It is climbing to the \"hype\" train. I googled \"Forbes about API,\" and on the first page, I found six(!) Forbes articles about APIs published in 2022 (1,\u00a02,\u00a03,\u00a04,\u00a05,\u00a06). Forbes as a media and API are very distant from each other worlds. It proves the increasing interest in everything related to APIs.</p> <p>Thus, API design-first is also a part of this trend. Now we talk more about APIs and try to revisit some traditional approaches. There is a new market of tools to replace regular API development or integration with more user and business-friendly solutions.</p>","tags":["API Design"]},{"location":"posts/api-design-first/#when-you-dont-need-this","title":"When you don't need this","text":"<p>To fully understand the concept, you need to focus on its disadvantages more than its advantages. There is a bulletproof fact: despite trends, the industry has been developing software without API design-first for dozens of years and will continue doing that.</p> <p>The API design-first approach can be an overhead in a case when:</p> <p>1) There are internal APIs only / no time for that</p> <p>I can hardly imagine a viable system without an API exposed to 3rd parties. But if we consider this case, API design-first is hard to sell here. If API is only used by the UI application, why do you need to spend time designing API with stakeholders before coding? Especially when we are talking about small or medium-sized applications.</p> <p>Also, you need more time to design API. For sure, it is an overhead. If it is outside your initial plans, then it is unlikely to spend any effort on that. That might end up as a technical debt. But there is always a price we pay for the rush.</p> <p>2) No API conventions on the team or organizational level</p> <p>Having API conventions is crucial in any case: whether you design or code first. Without the conventions, you are doomed to redesign API repeatedly, trying to match pieces of broken glass. For an API in production that might end up with breaking changes. And no one likes breaking changes (I wrote the\u00a0essay\u00a0dedicated to that).</p> <p>3) Lacks stakeholder involvement/lack of knowledge in API</p> <p>API design-first is about collaboration among stakeholders. If API is not a priority for them, then the API design phase can be delegated to developers while implementing those APIs (or a little prior).</p> <p>Another case is when stakeholders are willing to participate but can't speak \"API language.\" OpenAPI, for instance, can be used as such a language. But learning a language needs personal effort. Not talking about mastering the OpenAPI specifics, just understanding the basic concepts (grammar) and the ability to express yourself and understand others.</p> <p>Thus, if stakeholders want to be involved in the API design but do not speak an API language or speak another API language (e.g., SOAP), there should be time dedicated to learning.</p> <p>4) (Very) extensive system</p> <p>To finalize some skepticism, applying the design-first approach for a very extensive system that may include hundreds of microservices is not reasonable. Spending time designing the API of each specific microservice is not the best idea. You'd better spend time creating templates or boilerplates for API facades. Some business-sensitive APIs can be designed, considering the specifics: security, customer needs, and government regulations.</p>","tags":["API Design"]},{"location":"posts/api-design-first/#where-to-learn-about-designing-api","title":"Where to learn about designing API","text":"<p>Whether you have decided to apply the API design-first or are just interested in learning more about API, there is a proven-by-me list of resources to help you:</p> <ul> <li>A brilliant free\u00a0course\u00a0published at\u00a0https://idratherbewriting.com.

The worst option is to send them a link to a Jira ticket with a poor description and a mess in the comments. The best option is to write a comprehensive migration guide. Developers might consider writing such a guide a waste of time, but it is an investment to reduce future support activities.</p> <p>3) Migration support</p> <p>A comprehensive guide will not save you from additional communications: answering questions, helping with the update, and fixing bugs. So be prepared to have a support buffer in your team's capacity. Or even better, super-obvious advice: always have a support buffer.</p> <p>4) Support timeline for previous releases</p> <p>Customers may postpone the update to an unknown time due to various reasons. And they may keep requesting improvements and bug fixes for an older version they currently use. That ends up supporting several releases: moving forward with new releases and producing backports to the previous ones.</p> <p>The backports continuously require more efforts from the team, shifting focus from the future to the past. The more gap you have, the more challenging it is to improve an older version. It is not a trivial task from both a development and testing perspective that can trigger unexpected problems.</p> <p>To fight this, you must include another point in the contract: how long you commit to supporting previous versions. In my practice, there was a case when we supported five previous major releases. That was a solid argument to speed up the update. As we had a 2-week release cycle, the customers had about two months to plan and conduct the update.</p> <p>Frequent updates may not be typical for your industry. That period may vary due to different business contexts. Or you have a good old customer with a fat bank account unwilling to migrate soon. And the senior management will eat you alive if you try to push the unwanted update. That is mainly the organization or program-wide question.

It sounds oversimplified, but this is how it is.</p> <p>In detaching API from the functionality, meaning we have a variety of APIs for different consumers, I like an association with a \"door.\" Despite any context, the primary function of a door is to change its state from closed to open and vice versa. The door can be built from different materials, and it can be opened by various means. The opened door can lead to different locations. But its primary function remains the same.

API should return a meaningful error message so a consumer can understand what happened and what they should do to get a successful result with the next call. </p> <p>There are 4xx and 5xx HTTP status codes, so you don't need to reinvent the wheel. The best practice is to have an Errors template with common cases such as 401, 404, and 500, with the possibility of extending them with custom errors. The custom errors should still be based on the HTTP status codes, so pick the code wisely.</p> <p>There is a classic case with the codes: if a Search API does not find any result, it should return 404 (Not found) or 200 (OK).</p> <p>One more area is error resilience: what happens if something goes wrong in the request logic? For example, your API call is trying to reach a currently unavailable service. There are several scenarios for the so-called Circuit Breaker:</p> <ul> <li>Throw an error immediately.</li> <li>Try several times.</li> <li>Use a plan B to reach a duplicate of that service after trying several times.</li> </ul> <p>Another issue is with composite API: you should make two requests to aggregate data across different services. One responded, another didn't. Your composite API can return an error. Or it can return partial or even mock data. But remember to notify a consumer that data needs to be completed.</p> <p>A weak point of composite API requests is transaction consistency. When an API endpoint triggers an update operation in several services, an issue may occur if some service does not proceed.

About 10 PM. I am on the call with a Team Lead (TL) discussing the sprint closure. We really struggled a few previous iterations having a very low team velocity vs our quarter roadmap plans. Several big technical features were continuously dragged from sprint to sprint with multiple issues appearing along the way. </p> <p>But this sprint is different. We have managed to close those big features, handle a few customer requests, and fix a bunch of bugs. I did some calculations and that appeared to be our best sprint for the last 7 (!) months. The team is encouraged as it seems we have overcome that dark period.</p> <p>But this is not what we are talking about with TL. We are discussing 2 medium-sized features that have been developed but not yet tested. They were delivered to a testing environment late today, so our QA already ended her working day. If we could close those features right now, the sprint result will be outstanding. The team really worked hard and deserved that.</p> <p>\u201cWhat will we do with the features?\u201d TL asked. I am a Product Owner and I have the power to decide whether a feature is completed or needs additional work to be done.</p> <p>\u201cListen, those features are quite small improvements of non-critical functionality. They passed dev testing phase and I personally checked them. All works as expected. Right?\u201d I don\u2019t want to lose the outstanding number I already calculated in my mind. And I am determined to make that happen.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you suggest? Close the tickets without real testing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you are right. As I said, that is not a critical functionality. I don\u2019t see any risks there. Let\u2019s set them as non-QA, close, and go rest. We did a really great job so we all deserved that\u201d, I can sound very convincing.</p> <p>\u201cOK, I agree\u201d.</p> <p>After some manipulations, the features were considered as done, the tickets were resolved and the Sprint was closed. Time to enjoy the weekend.</p> <p>Saturday morning I received a message from our QA Lead (QL). \u201cHi, I saw you had closed those 2 tickets as non-QA\u201d.</p> <p>I am ready to defend, \u201cYes. Developers finished them very late so you were already off. They are quite small so I decided to complete them as non-QA\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOK. I just wondering, do we need to cover them with automated tests?\u201d</p> <p>F*ck. We\u2019d better cover them with autotests. But that means the QA team needs to write testing scenarios, validate them, and then proceed with automation. Basically, to do the work I previously defined as \u201cnot needed\u201d by converting the features to non-QA.</p> <p>I take a pause. There is a growing feeling that I have done something very stupid. I manipulated with features and moved testing activities in \u201ca shadow mode\u201d to the next Sprint and proudly announced that they are completed. But they are not. I start feeling sick.</p> <p>\u201cYes, we need to automate both features\u201d, it took me about 30 minutes to answer her.</p> <p>\u201cOK, no problem. Next week I will pass it to the QA team and we will proceed with the automation. Have a nice weekend!\u201d</p> <p>That weekend was not nice for me at all. I passed through the Five stages \u2013 denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. I fought with my ego which was obsessed with the numbers and wanted to achieve high results, even fictional, at any cost.</p> <p>Next Monday we had a team retrospective call. I apologized to the entire team. I confessed that I manipulated tickets for the only reason to satisfy my ego with good stats. I spoiled a really great team achievement and now QAs had to cover my ass with that testing.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I did is stupid. I am really sorry. I will never do that again\u201d.</p> <p>And I am keeping my promise. Now, by the end of each Sprint, I consider only what is really done. I am no longer pushing tickets for good stats. I don\u2019t really know how many story points my team closed last sprint or earlier. I am smiling when some managers report something like \u201cWe completed 1000 story points during a last sprint/quarter/year\u201d. I am no longer playing that game.</p> <p>I am focused on the value we, as the Team, can produce for our customers.

It is impossible to foresee the number of bugs, feature requests, and questions from other teams and customers. Each with the highest priority, of course. That can block the development of new features and break all the plans you committed before.</p> <p>The only way I found is to become ruthless in filtering \"urgent\" support items to complete. No more Mr. Nice Guy. You must become a gateway that needs to be passed so a team will take a support item, not from the queue. I am that guy who will stand against your request, even if it is crucial until you prove it is a real priority. Of course, you can go upstairs and push it through via higher management, but I will fight till the end to protect my team's backlog.</p> <p>Of course, I expected that pressure.

Gharajedaghi\u2019s \"System Thinking\"","text":"<p>This is a new rubric in my blog as I tried to avoid any posts about specific books before. I am taking some notes about the best books I have read. But those are not for the public eye. So this piece was not originally planned to be published. I just feel a need to share something with the world after I read a book in the title. Because that was a wonderful but pretty tough experience.</p> <p>Before we begin, let\u2019s make clear that:</p> <ul> <li>It is not a review. I will not write about bad books in my blog. By default, any book which has a separate essay is worth reading. Period.</li> <li>That will be in the form of an internal dialog.</li> </ul> <p>OK. What is the full title of this book?</p> <p>\u201cSystem Thinking: Managing Chaos and Complexity: A Platform for Designing Business Architecture\u201d by Jamshid Gharajedaghi, 3rd edition</p> <p>Nice. How did you learn about this book?</p> <p>A few years ago when I was listening to a podcast with a guest talking about System Thinking. He stated that the book is quite hard to read and should be considered as a final bullet after you have already read other sources. I accepted the challenge and bought the book on Amazon.</p> <p>I guess you read something about System Thinking before, right?</p> <p>Correct, I read a few books before. So I considered myself mature enough to have a shot at something more serious on that topic. I was too naive. Gharajedaghi\u2019s \u201cSystem Thinking\u201d at the same time was an exciting and difficult reading experience. It took me more than a year to read those 376 pages.</p> <p>Oh. Why was that so harsh?</p> <p>Several reasons. First of all, the topic itself is quite complex. Secondly, it is not an introductory book. It expects that you are familiar with a lot of concepts. Third, a written language. I am not a native English speaker so I can judge only from my reading experience but it was hard to pass through some passages. I consulted with an English dictionary a lot. Some word choices and syntax constructions confused me. I will not dive into examples, but \u201cdissemination of power\u201d sounds weird to me. In this context, \u201cdissemination\u201d means \u201cdistribution\u201d, I get it. And this is a very lightweight example.</p> <p>Also, I mistakenly approached this book as non-fiction. It is neither non-fiction nor a scientific reading. It is something beyond. Two times I re-started the reading and my third attempt was successful because I changed the reading approach.</p> <p>The thing is that when you stop reading for a week at least, it is difficult to jump back to the context. Just because of how deep this book goes you need to stay focused until the end or you go out. With my 3rd attempt, I started making summaries of the most complex chapters. If I stopped reading even for a few days, I did a recap of the previous chapters to dive in again. And that worked out for me.</p> <p>Now tell us more about the book</p> <p>Chapters 1 and 2 serve as an introduction to systems and the movement toward System Thinking. But that is not an introduction for beginners because it does not cover the basics. You will get a general idea about the whole thing, but that will not prepare you for what comes next.</p> <p>Chapters 2-9 are more theoretical. It uncovers concepts of sociocultural systems and different modes of thinking to understand those systems. And this is the hardest part of the book, where I failed 2 times and had to start reading again. Some thoughts are repeated in different parts of the book, but it is absolutely necessary to read those chapters carefully.</p> <p>Chapters 10-14 are the business cases from Jamshid Gharajedaghi\u2019s outstanding consulting experience. It is more relaxing reading than the preceding theoretical part and is more about applying that theory in practice. My only concern is that those cases focus on the \u201cTO-BE\u201d part, skipping the \u201cformulating the mess\u201d and how the implementation happened (if happened). It is a big deal to design the right solution but that needs to be implemented and delivered at the end. Unfortunately, that is not fully addressed in the book, but for obvious reasons: you will need another book.</p> <p>Also, some cases took place in the 1990s, and since those times some \u201cTO-BE\u201d suggestions are considered more like the industry standards today rather than insights. But this is a good sign actually as they have proved to be vital.</p> <p>What did you learn from this book?</p> <p>Not an easy question. I will definitely keep revisiting my notes and some chapters of the book. But I will try to formulate what I have so far:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Most business and management concepts has been originated in the 1950-1970s. Currently, we just keep re-inventing the wheel and putting it in a new colorful package to sell as courses. It is not a new idea either, but I have just become more convinced about that.</p> </li> <li> <p>As an IT person, I approached each system as software. Then, while reading more and more about System Thinking I started considering a system as something more technically advanced: a flight or an F1 car. This book gives a wider perspective on a higher level - sociocultural systems. Each organization is a sociocultural system. And that itself is a more complex being than any piece of software.</p> </li> <li> <p>5 Dimensions of social systems and the importance of their generation and distribution (\u201cdissemination\u201d): wealth, power, knowledge, beauty, value. If the first three are pretty obvious, beauty and value give me an additional perspective when now looking at social systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distribution without effective production can only result in equal distribution of poverty.</p> </li> <li> <p>The importance of communicating the shared image as leverage to transformation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Formulating the mess is sometimes more important than designing a solution. A quote by Russel L. Ackoff mentioned in the book: \u201cWe fail more often not because we fail to solve the problems we face but because we fail to face right problems\u201d.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Again, that might seem pretty obvious but it is really huge. Further I keep going, and the more I keep asking myself what the hell I am doing and for what reason someone needs that (shit).</p> <p>Let\u2019s stop on those six. But there are more, definitely.</p> <p>You mentioned that this book is not for beginners. What do you recommend for people who want to get acquainted with System Thinking?</p> <p>\u201cThinking in Systems\u201d by Donella H. Meadows. No doubt, the best introduction to this topic.</p> <p>Then start looking for other materials to dive deeper - you need to have some background for Gharajedaghi\u2019. Don\u2019t repeat my mistakes.</p> <p>Take care,</p> <p>Ilya</p>","tags":["BA & PO","Career","Books"]},{"location":"posts/reading-product-management-in-enterprise/","title":"Thoughts about \"Building Products for the Enterprise: Product Management in Enterprise Software\" by B.

That time it is one of the most valuable books I have read about Product management: \"Building Products for the Enterprise: Product Management in Enterprise Software\" by Blair Reeves and Benjamin Gaines.</p> <p></p> <p>OK. I am glad you are finally talking about this book. It is an obvious question, but I must ask it. What this book is about?</p> <p>The title is self-explanatory enough: the book is about being a Product Manager (PM) in a B2B Enterprise organization.</p> <p>Sounds fair. What is so unique about working in the Enterprise compared to other PMs?</p> <p>First, let's agree that Product management is a vast discipline. Every organization looks at it from a different angle. So, a PM's responsibilities and role definition might vary for similar products but from other businesses in the same market.</p> <p>Enterprise PM differs from a startup PM in that the first needs to survive in a complex hierarchy, build relationships, and comply with an Enterprise's restrictions. Also, it depends on whether it is B2B, B2C, B2G, B2B2B, etc. That impacts a lot on how products are developed and sold.</p> <p>I will paraphrase the book to not expand on this topic further. What makes PM in the Enterprise different:</p> <ul> <li>business model: usually direct sales or subscription</li> <li>specialization: very specialized products</li> <li>the split between customers and users</li> </ul> <p>Understood. Is there any story about how you found that book?</p> <p>At some point in my career as a Business analyst, I consumed all materials about Product Management I could only find. I considered buying that book while visiting the biggest bookstore in Dubai, UAE (I spent multiple hours and money there instead of relaxing on a beach).</p> <p>But the book appeared too thin and expensive, so I bought another about product management. And I will write about that particular book very soon as it is worthwhile. A few years later, I bought it on Amazon.</p> <p>Alright. What is the main idea of the book?</p> <p>There are several ideas. The first I already mentioned is that the PM role in the Enterprise is different. They start with a statement that the PM is not the CEO of the product. And I 100% agree. You are executing the vision of the executives or senior management. You might sell them your vision or align your vision with theirs. But you are very limited in power, so you need to choose your tactics and tools wisely.</p> <p>Then, the authors raise an important topic that stands out for B2B: the separation between user and customer.</p> <p>And how does that separation work?</p> <p>Quoting the book, in B2B, another organization hires your product to help it grow. So, who pays is your customer who will use your product according to their goals.</p> <p>End users are far away and sometimes out of touch. Their interests might be different from the ones of the customers.</p> <p>But PM can't just ignore users. They might know customers and their business, understand users' needs, and find a balance.</p> <p>That is challenging. What else?</p> <p>In further chapters, the authors describe 3 types of knowledge for a PM to seek and master:</p> <ul> <li>Organizational knowledge</li> <li>Product knowledge</li> <li>Industry knowledge</li> </ul> <p>OK. Let's start with the Organizational type and then cover others individually.</p> <p>Organizational knowledge\u00a0is about how to work with internal teams, marketing, sales, and executives.</p> <p>Ultimate PM's goal is to drive alignment across teams in complex organizations. You can't do everything alone inside your team and department. You must cooperate with other people from different divisions. That might be extremely difficult as some of them might give a shit about what you are doing and have their own, sometimes contradictory, agenda. It can be seen as fitting pieces of a puzzle that do not fit.</p> <p>Also, the PM is involved in Politics, which is inevitable. So, you need time (a few years) to learn how to navigate that environment and build relationships and trust with the support you need.</p> <p>Feedback loops and delivery in Enterprise are prolonged compared to startups. You need to know the process and the shortcuts to become efficient as a PM. If you don't have the right background and existing connections for a new job, working one year or less is not enough to make a prominent impact. You need more time to acquire all the tools and the remaining types of knowledge to deliver results.</p> <p>Product knowledge\u00a0is pretty straightforward, as PMs must know their product or products. It would help if you learned it in a way your customers and users do to build empathy with them.</p> <p>The authors suggest that PM should also have a basic understanding of how the system behind your product works - basic architecture. That really helps to understand limitations.</p> <p>You need to understand the product lifecycle, where your product is, and how the development process goes with all nuances. Also, the PM must clearly communicate product release information so the customer understands how new functionality could be valuable to them (see, not talking about users there).</p> <p>Industry knowledge\u00a0is the most crucial and the most difficult to get. It would help if you had a lot of time to understand your market. Not only one market but also related markets as well.</p> <p>You need to know your typical customers, their use cases, and their problems. Plus, you need to know how to sell it.</p> <p>It is essential to have a good knowledge of your competitors. But at the same time, avoid becoming obsessed with them and competition in general.</p> <p>And it would be best if you kept running. Constantly. Keep tracking and learning to get some market insights and understand how other markets are impacting yours, as they are not in isolated silos.</p> <p>Challenge your knowledge, as industry experts might be wrong. The authors give a great example. I also witnessed when, 10 years ago, only some people believed big Enterprises would move to the Cloud. But we now see that it has happened.</p> <p>Got it. What are you overall feeling about the book?</p> <p>I am very upset when I don't see that book in different tops of the Product management books. It is a hidden gem.</p> <p>This is not a giant book, but it contains a lot of valuable concepts. It is not an ultimate guide: it will not teach you to build roadmaps and research a market. But that is not the purpose of the book.</p> <p>The first time I read it was when I was a Business analyst who wanted to become a Product manager. As I have always worked on Enterprise projects, the book resonates with me. All other sources were mainly about B2C and startups in particular. And even then, I felt it does not match well with enterprises.</p> <p>The second time I read that book, I had already been in a PM position for several years.</p> <p>I refreshed my memories, found new insights, and changed my attitude to some given advice as I know I have some experience in that field as well.</p> <p>So, I recommend that book to future and current PMs to better understand how to navigate the Enterprise world and B2B and its variations in particular.</p> <p>Thank you and take care,</p> <p>Ilya</p>","tags":["Product Management","Career","Books"]},{"location":"posts/sidekick-product/","title":"Sidekick product","text":"","tags":["Product Management"]},{"location":"posts/sidekick-product/#sidekick-product","title":"Sidekick product","text":"<p>Throughout my career, I participated in the development of a few supplements for so-called \u201cparent\u201d products.

What I learned from my experience (in a hard way), the wrong decisions from the start, even for the supplement, are very difficult to handle on the way.

Flexible vision &amp; great expectations</p> <p>After starting building something \u201cquick and dirty\u201d you might very soon realize that it is not \u201cquick\u201d anymore. And this becoming dirtier and dirtier. It is a common situation for any product, but for the Sidekicks that is more fatal compared to others. Different sides push it in different directions which have been not considered from the beginning.</p> <p>Sometimes that is for good: history knows a lot of examples when a Sidekick resulted in a successful standalone product or even a new business. But history usually avoids mentioning a graveyard of the products with a such \u201cflexible\u201d vision.</p> <p>Stakeholders are excited about the new opportunities. Each has its own view on what should be added to make a proper solution. That causes an overload and losing the initial vision of the product. In the end, that leads to failed expectations from different parties.</p> <p>You\u2019d better know what you are going to build. And also, be pretty confident about what you are not. </p> <p>2. Prolongating MVP development</p> <p>This is an obvious consequence of Point 1. Unnecessary prolongation of an MVP stage is a common disease in any industry. But with a Sidekick, it is relatively easy to fall into an endless extending/redoing cycle. The unclear vision and desire to address the needs of every stakeholder makes the exit very complicated.</p> <p>On the other hand, if your MVP appears to be not very \u201cV\u201d (viable/valuable) because of the rush and not listening to the right guys, then welcome to the Sidekicks\u2019 graveyard.</p> <p>3. Lack of architecture guidance</p> <p>A Sidekick is expected to have a very quick time-to-market period. And such phrases as \u201cLet\u2019s deal with (put your option) later\u201d on the MVP stage, along with quick and unjustified tech decisions, could lead to the exhausting on-the-fly architecture changes. Lack of the proper architecture guidance from the start may cause time-consuming refactorings when a Sidekick becomes mature and need to address more complex functionality.</p> <p>Especially that hurts when your go live with it. Your team quickly realizes itself buried in the problems with scaling, performance, and integration. And the Security team is knocking on your door with a bunch of found vulnerabilities to be resolved ASAP. I bet you haven\u2019t got that planned initially.</p> <p>4. Team unfocus</p> <p>If you launch a Sidekick be sure your team will develop it along with the main product. I don\u2019t have any data on this, so let it be my assumption: you are unlikely to get a new team or new hires for a supplement. That might happen in later stages when a Sidekick proves its stake. But for the beginning, you are likely to handle that with what you have.</p> <p>Considering points 1-3, you can imagine how that affects the main product. All that might seem to be a temporary shift in the priority to push the Sidekick as much as possible and return to the mainline later. In the worst case, you found yourself chasing two hares with low chances to catch any.</p> <p>5. Selecting a new technology stack</p> <p>The team might be eager to try new frameworks, programming languages, and libraries with a Sidekick. Nothing bad with that, but you should consider the risks which appear there. Lack of experience may introduce architectural issues and a bigger tech debt to be resolved if the Sidekick transition to a mature \u201cproduction-ready\u201d service. The cost might be too high.</p> <p>Also, the learning curve for new technology can be very long. That causes potential issues with implementing complex features so the team will be not able to resolve that without outside help. That is OK when someone in your organization has experience with that stack and can dedicate some time to help you. But if not then you are in trouble. Hiring a new developer for that purpose or engaging a contractor/freelancer brings risks to a new level. Waiting until the team will be experienced enough to handle the complex feature might not be an option as well.</p> <p>6. Selecting the same stack as the \u201cParent\u201d</p> <p>The team is familiar with the technology so we do expect that even complex issues will be resolved in the known domain. However, there are new risks here:</p> <ul> <li>Bringing bad practices from the Parent to the Sidekick.</li> <li>Unnecessary tying the Parent with the Sidekick.</li> </ul> <p>Using the \u201cParent\u201d stack seems to be an easier way. And, actually, it does. However, there might be cases when some solutions could be done better (quicker and with more quality) if developers were not looking back on the Parent and bringing some practices from it. Those practices might be good there, but it is not always the case for the Sidekick.</p> <p>Also, tying the Sidekick with the Parent on the program and infrastructure levels can result in a very painful divorce. Such kind of migration will freeze the implementation of new features and cost many efforts.</p> <p>The best recipe is not to be afraid to bring some innovation and explore new technological capabilities for a new product.

There are a few reasons:</p> <ul> <li>LinkedIn is not promoting its native articles enough. I did some research and compared the metrics - LinkedIn articles are getting less traction than the posts. I am not chasing the big numbers, but it is disappointing when people don't see good materials.</li> <li>Native LinkedIn articles are not as good at editing and publishing as other platforms.</li> <li>LinkedIn is more about quick \"Tik-tok\"-like content: short posts and videos, memes, and more generic stuff. It is not a place for longer and more complex articles.</li> </ul> <p>However, LinkedIn will stay as my primary social platform. I will move articles to different platforms but continue publishing links and short posts there.</p> <p>Medium: my new social platform</p> <p>As some of you probably noticed, I published the latest part of the No-code series on Medium (please feel free to subscribe). Now it is a place where I will publish my articles. In a short time, I will migrate there my previous posts as well.</p> <p>The reason is pretty simple: to attract a new audience. Even though the competition there is high, Medium is a better place for a mid-length reading about professional topics.</p> <p>Blog: how it will differ from Medium</p> <p>My Blog will continue to be a central hub for my content.

Some of them were not only displaying docs in Swagger UI but also worked kind of. My overall purpose was not only to talk about APIs from the Business Analysis perspective but to show them.</p> <p>Doing a retrospective of the original workshop, it needed some real API for people to interact with. Even a webinar where I talk for about an hour could be a more interactive format; it is a considerable step in that direction. If I do the API workshop again, I could give participants near-to-real API examples to integrate using FastAPI.</p> <p>I like to talk about tooling like every blacksmith likes to talk about their hammer. We have covered Swagger Editor, JSight, and Stoplight to represent different perspectives of API design.</p> <p>I decided not to dive into OpenAPI specification review as enough materials could do it better than me. I just shared an example and a few resources to learn.</p> <p>Also, I updated the API requirements (v3 currently) template using some feedback I received since Part 1. A few things needed to be corrected and more consistent there. Plus, I made it clear in terms of data structure description.</p> <p>At the end of Part 2, while reviewing a practical case, I revealed a custom format I use for textual API specification. It isn't for everyone, and the previous example seems more conventional. At least, that is how I approach API requirements and design based on some Client's input.</p> <p>Overall, doing two webinars at a two-week interval took a month of preparation. I thought it would be easier considering the amount of materials  I produced before. However, I took a complex way to give my best with new information resources, examples, approaches, etc.</p> <p>As I mentioned in my previous post, I still like giving offline speeches where I can interact with an audience and track their mood. But I need to get experience in making the webinars too.</p> <p>It was surprising for me that doing Zoom calls as work presentations and an open webinar are opposite things.
